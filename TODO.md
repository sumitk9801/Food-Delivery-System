# TODO: Investigate Database Connectivity for Order Placement

## Completed Steps
- [x] Read backend/config/db.js to check database connection
- [x] Read backend/controllers/orderController.js to understand order placement logic
- [x] Read backend/models/orderModel.js to verify order schema
- [x] Read frontend/src/PAGES/PlaceOrder/placeOrder.jsx to check frontend order submission
- [x] Read backend/server.js to confirm DB connection and route setup
- [x] Read backend/routes/orderRoute.js to verify order route
- [x] Read backend/controllers/cartController.js to understand cart management
- [x] Read frontend/src/context/StoreContext.jsx to check cart state management
- [x] Read backend/middleware/auth.js to verify authentication
- [x] Added detailed logging around order.save() in orderController.js to catch save errors
- [x] Updated StoreContext.jsx to call backend cart API for addToCart and removeFromCart
- [x] Added loadCart function to sync cart from database on login
- [x] Fixed ObjectId casting errors by changing foodId to string in models
- [x] Updated cartController to use findOne instead of findById for food check
- [x] Removed food existence check in cartController as foods are static
- [x] Updated orderController to handle string foodId

## Pending Steps
- [ ] Test adding items to cart and verify they are saved in the database
- [ ] Test placing an order and verify it is saved in the database
- [ ] Monitor backend logs for any errors during cart operations
- [ ] Optionally, clear cart after successful order placement
